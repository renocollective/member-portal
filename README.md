The Member Portal is an open source community software project built by and for the Reno Collective. This application will provide the members of the Reno Collective with a way to better network and share ideas with one another.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine.

## Built With
* [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)

## Development Setup

Make sure that you already have Xcode on your machine before running the following commands. To install xcode run:
```shell
xcode-select --install
```
An install window will appear. Click install to begin installing Xcode.

If rvm isn't already installed on your machine, [install rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)
After installing rvm, you may need to close the terminal and open it back up in order to successfully run an rvm.

To update or install Ruby 2.3.5, run:
```shell
rvm install 2.3.5
```

To use Ruby V.2.3.5, run:
```shell
rvm use 2.3.5
```

To install Rails V5.1.4, run:
```shell
gem install rails -v 5.1.4
```

To install PostgreSQL, make sure your brew is up to date. If you don't yet have homebrew installed, install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

Run the following command lines:
```shell
brew doctor
```
```shell
brew update
```

If you don't have PostgreSQL installed, run:
```shell
brew install postgresql
```

The postgresql server may need to be started if it isn't already running. To start the server,
run:
```shell
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start && brew services start postgresql
```

Clone this git repository by running:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/renocollective/member-portal
```
Now you should have a local copy of the member-portal project.

Once cloning the member portal, switch to the project directory:
```shell
cd member-portal
```
Before you can successfully run the project, you need to install all the dependencies for the Rail application by running:
```shell
bundle install
```
To successfully run this command, you will need to have bundler installed. To install bundler:
```shell
gem install bundler
```

For the application to successfully run, you will need to create a .env.local file. Copy and paste the text in the .env file into the new .env.local file.


Next, run:
```shell
rails db:setup
rails db:migrate
```

To start and run the rails application:
```shell
rails s
```
Now you should be able to view the rails app at http://localhost:3000/
